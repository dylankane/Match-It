# MATCH IT

In this section, you will include a few paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
Essentially, this part is your "sales pitch".

At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it!
Don't introduce the project as a "portfolio project" for the diploma.

In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target, and how it will be useful to the target audience.

This is the Match it game. A memory game, designed for kids. The game consists of 12 cards, placed face down. The card faces have 12 images, 6  pairs of images, the aim is to find each set of pairs. The user can click on a card or touch on screen to flip it over to reveal the card face. A second card then has to be flipped. If the image on these two cards match they will stay flipped over, and change colour. If they are not a match they will flip back over, so the user can no longer see the images. Another two cards can then be flipped, to try and find a matching pair. The idea is the user has to remember which card has which image, allowing them to find all the matching pairs. There is a time limit, so they must find all the pairs before the clock runs out.

This is a simple game, easy to figure out, but engaging. Can be played in a short amount of time. It is fun and helps to develop memory skills. Not meant to be played for hours on end, so it is ideal for parents to allow kids to play, in short bursts. It is quick for the user to understand what has to be done and can start a game instantly ant any stage.
On the go with a smart phone or tablet, or at home with a laptop or desktop.

Once the page has loaded the cards will be shuffled in to a random order. The game begins, on the first click of a card, starting the timer and counting the number of moves / flips.
If completed, and all 6 pairs have been found before the timer runs out. A congratulations modal if pop up, telling the user the numer of moves they completed the game in. from that modal they can restart the game, which will re-shuffle the cards into a new random order.
If the game is not completed within the time, a similar modal will appear letting them know they hve not succeded. Game can be restarted from this modal also, bringing the user back to the main game area.

Although this is aimed at a youger audience it has not been made too childish or gaudish, encouraging all ages to give it a go, either to compete with thir kids or simply as a quick mental break for adults while having a coffee break, or even on the toilet :). A quick game can clear the head, and not fill you with the usual social media dribble. stimulating but not too challenging. It can also lead to some competitivness, trying to beat someone elses score or just your own score. 

The design is simple, a landing area with nothing but a logo, and a play game button. once the play game button is clicked the page will automatically slide down to he main game area. the background colour changes, and the 12 cards, face down appear in a grid.
Above the card gris are two features. The move counter and the timer. Below the grid are two clickable pieces of text. The restart button allowing the user to restart the game at any point. And a how to play button, this when clicked will slide the page down to a section where the instuctions on how to play the game, are shown. Finally below this is a simple footer with the creaters name.

All these sections are coloured with the same scheme, alternating the background colors, as you scroll down. 

It is designed to be fresh stimulating and as apealling visually to adults and kids.
The images used on the face of the cards, are a throwback to old retro games, images of a gameboy, old console, a joystick, a mario feature, pacman and a screen with an old ping pong game.
This is meant to resonate with older players of the game and also being colourful and fun for the youger users, which through reseach with my own kids still love playing the old retro games.




Consider adding a mockup image using the "Am I Responsive" website.
Here's your deployed site as an example:
https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://dylankane.github.io/Match-It

Screenshots for the README and testing should not be inside of `assets/` or `static/` image folders.
(reminder: `assets/` and `static/` are for files used on the live site, not documentation)
Consider adding a new folder called `documentation`, and add the amiresponsive screenshot inside of that folder.
To add the image into your README, use this format:
(assuming you have a new folder called `documentation` with an image called "mockup.png")

![screenshot](documentation/mockup.png)

Note: Markdown files (.md) should not contain HTML elements like `img`, `br`, `div`, `a`, etc, only Markdown formatting.
Find out more about using Markdown elements here:
https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

## UX

In this section, you will briefly explain your design processes.

### Colour Scheme

Explain your colours and the colour scheme.

- `#000000` used for primary text.
- `#E84610` used for primary highlights.
- `#4A4A4F` used for secondary text.
- `#009FE3` used for secondary highlights.

Consider adding a link and screenshot for your colour scheme using "coolors".
https://coolors.co/generate

When you add a colour to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your colour palette later if needed.

Example:

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)

If you've used CSS `:root` variables, consider also including a code snippet here!

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    --yellow: rgb(217, 223, 122);
    --green: rgb(124, 203, 175);
    --grey: rgb(65, 65, 65);
    --highlight: rgb(0, 0, 0);
}
```

### Typography

Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like Google Fonts and/or Font Awesome.

Consider adding a link to each font used, and the Font Awesome site if used (or similar icon library).

Example:

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project,
and describe each in a sentence or so.

You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user,
focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve,
and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

IMPORTANT: Remember to always include a screenshot of each individual feature!

### Existing Features

- **Feature #1**

    - Details about this particular feature, including the value to the site, and benefit for the user. Be as detailed as possible!

![screenshot](documentation/feature01.png)

- **Feature #2**

    - Details about this particular feature, including the value to the site, and benefit for the user. Be as detailed as possible!

![screenshot](documentation/feature02.png)

- **Feature #3**

    - Details about this particular feature, including the value to the site, and benefit for the user. Be as detailed as possible!

![screenshot](documentation/feature03.png)

Repeat as necessary for as many features as your site contains.

Hint: the more, the merrier!

### Future Features

Do you have additional ideas that you'd like to include on your project in the future?
Fantastic! List them here!
It's always great to have plans for future improvements!
Consider adding any helpful links or notes to help remind you in the future, if you revisit the project in a couple years.

- Cool new feature #1
    - Any additional notes about this feature.
- Cool new feature #2
    - Any additional notes about this feature.
